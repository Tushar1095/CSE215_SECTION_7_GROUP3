# Dungeon Quest Game

**Dungeon Quest** is a text-based adventure game developed in **Java** using **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI). It combines **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and random event-driven gameplay to create an interactive and engaging dungeon exploration experience. Players navigate through a dungeon, battling enemies, collecting treasures, and avoiding traps while managing their health.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Java**: Used for the core logic and GUI implementation.
- **Java Swing**: Utilized to design the graphical user interface.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The game structure is designed around core OOP principles such as:
  - **Encapsulation**: Data is hidden within classes to ensure that it is only accessible through well-defined methods.
  - **Inheritance**: Shared behaviors are abstracted into base classes and inherited by specialized classes.
  - **Polymorphism**: The gameâ€™s random events and player actions are dynamically processed through polymorphic methods.
- **Exception Handling**: Ensures the game can handle invalid user inputs and prevents crashes by catching errors gracefully.
